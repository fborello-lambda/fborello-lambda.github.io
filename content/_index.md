There are cases in which I have the willingness to write some documents or notes about a specific topic. The decision to write arises from the "fear" of forgetting about it. Later on, I may never revisit my writings, but it would be nice to keep them in one place, **`in case I forget`**.

Disclaimer: The notes and even the code may not make sense. The code may be flaky or poorly written, some calculations may be off, and I could have interpreted some concepts incorrectly, but the overall idea is what matters.
