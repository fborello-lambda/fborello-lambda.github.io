## Ethereum

## [Glossary](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/)

The Ethereum organization proposes some specs or improvements `EIPs` , this specs are what **_Architecture_** means for hardware.

Updates are released when a certain block height is met. All execution clients agree on the height.

System Contracts ‚Üí Contracts that provide general purpose code, some interact with the L1 like `Diamond`.
Contract‚Äôs events:

> You should emit an event anytime something occurs in your smart contract that some system outside the blockchain should be aware of so that the outside system may listen for such occurrences

Rollups:

- Optimistic
- zk Rollups
  - Validium ‚Üí Proofs are not stored on the blockchain.
  - Sometimes, a merkletree that contains all the transactions hashes is built and then the root composes the zk Proof that is later stored on the L1.

Rollup operation requires the assistance of an operator, who rolls transactions together, computes a zero-knowledge proof of the correct state transition, and affects the state transition by interacting with the rollup contract.

[Sharding](https://ethereum.org/es/roadmap/danksharding/)

zkEVM ‚Üí Solves the problem of creating a general purpose verifier. Taking into account that the `circuit` (Arithmetization of the problem) has to be fixed in order to verify proofs, the idea is to have a so called `Virtual Machine` that operates like a processor whose proof takes into account each step of the execution.

```sh
1 ETH = 1e18 wei

1 Gwei (for giga wei) = 1e9wei = 0.000000001 ETH

A standard transaction costs 21_000 gas.

Assume gas price 131 gwei

131 gwei/gas * 21_000 gas = 2_751_000 gwei = 0.002751 ETH

## Solidity

- Following the [REMIX IDE tutorial](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

Kick off Contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT // <-- License
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; // <-- Specify version

contract SimpleStorage {
    // State variable, stored in the Blockchain
    uint public n; // It is initialized to 0

    // A transaction is needed to change the state variable.
    function set(uint _n) public {
        n = _n;
    }

    // To read the variable you don't need to send a transaction.
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return n;
    }

    // Pure functions neither read nor write the Blockchain's state
    function add(uint i, uint j) public pure returns (uint) {
        return i + j;
    }
}
```

- Solidity interprets the `Contract` keyword as the ‚Äúentry point‚Äù, just like the `main` function in a programming language.
- Smart Contracts are atomic, if one operation fails, the entire operation is reverted without altering the Blockchain‚Äôs state.
- The variables that are outside `functions` are stored in the Blockchain. And are called `State variables` . A scheme of ‚Äúgetters‚Äù and ‚Äúsetters‚Äù is used.
  - If the function takes inputs like our¬†`set`¬†function (line 9), you must specify the parameter types and names. A common convention is to use an underscore as a prefix for the parameter name to distinguish them from state variables.
- `pure` and `view` functions don‚Äôt modify the Blockchain‚Äôs state.
  "The following statements are considered modifying the state:
  1. Writing to state variables / Reading from state variables.
  2. Emitting events.
  3. Creating other contracts.
  4. Using selfdestruct.
  5. Sending Ether via calls.
  6. Calling any function not marked view or pure.
  7. Using low-level calls.
  8. Using inline assembly that contains certain opcodes."
  9. Accessing¬†`address(this).balance`¬†or¬†`<address>.balance`.
  10. Accessing any of the members of block, tx, msg (with the exception of¬†`msg.sig`¬†and¬†`msg.data`).
- `Modifiers` and `Constructors`
  - A `Constructor` is called the first time the contract is deployed.
  - A `Modifier` is used to change the behavior of a function, in other words, it checks some parameters and executes the function. An `_` (underscore) is used to symbolize the function‚Äôs code: The code you place before the underscore in the modifier will be executed before the code in the body of the modified function. The code after the underscore will be executed after the code in the body of the modified function. [require](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions) keyword.
- Function visibilty:
  - private: only inside the contract
  - internal: inside the contract and by child contract
  - public: inside contract, child contract and other contracts or transactions
  - external: only called by other contracts or transactions, state variables can not be external

- DataTypes
  - Arrays
  - Enums
  - Structs
  - Mappings (Used to store values related to an `address`)
    - `mapping(address => uint) balance;`
    - Accessing: `balance[_addr];`
    - Nested mappings are allowed.

  - Storage: stores the data permanently on the Blockchain
    - Variables located inside a `contract` but outside `functions` are called State variables, and are stored in `storage` .
  - Memory: Values stored in¬†`memory`¬†are only stored temporarily and are not on the blockchain, variables inside `functions` are stored in memory, sometimes the keyword is needed to specify which type of DataLocation is needed.
  - Calldata:¬†stores function arguments. The data is stored temporarily and cannot be mutated.
  - Assignments:
    - Memory to Memory: This creates a reference.
    - ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù Storage to ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù Storage: This creates a reference.
    - Storage and Memory/Calldata: This creates a copy.
