A variable can be passed to the template, for example, the function show() calls render(conn, :show, item: items). , now the variable “item” can be accessed inside the template == :show == show.html.heex as follows: @items.

Here, in this module, we have the route items/new which “triggers” the new() function, whose view has the form previously defined, the form redirects to ~p\"/items\" with a POST request, this triggers the create() function. Finally, a redirection is performed to ~p\"/items/#{item.id}\", this route triggers the show() function. All this “operation” is possible because RESTful paths are defined in router.ex.\nHandle Errors with the case statement\nThis expression is really useful. If the insertion is made without errors, based on the Ecto.Changeset, it redirects to the show() function, else it redirects again to the new() function.\n\nInside the view:\nPhoenix Docs\n\nHow to edit?

Now, inside the controller:\n\nLook, the id is passed to the view, inside the view the following can be done:\n\nPhoenix seems smart enough to detect that the form was generated with an “edit” trigger, so the form will generate automatically a PUT response, but it can be explicitly defined with the “method” keyword.\nPhoenix in Action Summary of chapter 9\nGood workflow\n\nAdd the routes\nCreate the Controller and Add the functions\nCreate the html template (Views)\n\nRecap\n\nA RESTful resource contains actions for index, show, new, create, edit, update and delete.\nEach controller accepts two parameters, a Plug.Conn struct and the parameters from the user request.\n\n→ Note: Ecto.Schema virtual field for non-hashed passwords.

Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”\n\n\nModularity\nTransparency\n\nQuestions:\n\n\nHow does complexity relate to modularity?\nMore complexity results in larger programs, contrary to Unix’s philosophy. Modular and small programs that are not complex to use—although their internal parts may be complex—are preferred because they perform specific tasks effectively and facilitate proper communication between them.\n\n\nWhy is the text-stream interface important in the Unix Philosophy?\nThe text-stream interface serves as the communication interface between programs (via piping like “prog1 | prog2”).\n\n\nWhy should design for transparency encourage simple interfaces?\nTransparency aims to have a clean communication interface, debug programs/watchers, and should work on any program.\n\n\nHow does robustness relate to transparency and simplicity?\nRobustness means that a program is reliable. For example, if it depends on user input, the program should account for any possible—even impossible—situations. If it’s simple, the result should be more predictable, making it easier to monitor if the program follows transparency rules.\n\n\nEven with video processing, why should the output of programs be terse?\nBecause old programs that already work wouldn’t have a way to interface with newer ones. Following a convention and avoiding unexpected results help create new programs that can operate with both new and existing ones.\n\n\nAccording to the Unix Philosophy, how noisy should errors be?\nErrors should be as loud as possible, meaning the user should be notified. If a program B expects the output of program A and it fails, program B should receive an error. The way to handle the error depends on program B.\n\n\nHow does the economy of programmer time relate to robustness?\nIf software can write software, outcomes are faster, cheaper, and more reliable (robust).\n\n\nWhy does premature local optimization reduce overall performance?\nPremature optimization can overcomplicate the code, reducing performance. It’s recommended to create a working prototype first and then optimize.\n\n\nIf there is only \"one true way\" of doing things, how does it affect extensibility?\nIf there were only one way to do things, it would create a closed system where communications are restricted to a specific interface.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\n/root → first directory, where all directories are mounted to. (Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard).\n\n\nThe contents and/or purpose of a file is determined by other means. Although Unix-like operating systems don’t use file extensions to determine the contents/purpose of files, some application programs do. The file command gives a brief description of the file's contents.\n\n\n/usr/bin contains the executable programs installed\nby your Linux distribution. It is not uncommon for this\ndirectory to hold thousands of programs.\n\n\nUse of symbolic links or soft links and hard links. ln command to create soft/hard links.\n\n\ntype\n\nIndicates how a command name is interpreted.\n\n\n\nwhich\n\nDisplays which executable program will be executed.\n\n\n\nman\n\nDisplays a command’s manual page.\n\n\n\napropos\n\nDisplays a list of appropriate commands.\n\n\n\ninfo\n\nDisplays a command’s info entry.\n\n\n\nwhatis\n\nDisplays a very brief description of a command.\n\n\n\nalias\n\nCreates an alias for a command.\n\n\n\ncat\n\nConcatenates files.\n\n\n\nsort\n\nSorts lines of text.\n\n\n\nuniq\n\nReports or omits repeated lines.\n\n\n\nwc\n\nPrints newline, word, and byte counts for each file.\n\n\n\ngrep\n\nPrints lines matching a pattern.\n\n\n\nhead\n\nOutputs the first part of a file.\n\n\n\ntail\n\nOutput the last part of a file.\ntail -f prints and \"watches\" the file until ctrl-c. a file and can be used as input for the following program.\n\n\n\ntee\n\nRead from standard input and write to standard output and files.\ntee creates a \"T\" fitting on the pipe.

Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), a protocol that comes with a diversity of mechanisms to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data packets.\ntransport protocols: UDP(fast, but no reliable), TCP(reliable, uses a handshake mechanism), QUIC(uses a faster handshake mechanism)\nDomain Name System (DNS), a public, decentralized database that links a unique name to an IP address. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). DNS over HTTPS (DOH)\nHTTPS is purely defined as securing HTTP connections by means of the cryptographic protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nIn order to set up a TLS connection between server and client, their communicating nodes establish a shared secret key through a handshake. Server Name Indication (SNI), certificate authorities (CA).\n\n\n\n\nMany modern encryption algorithms feature Forward Secrecy, which ensures that intercepted and stored encrypted packets can’t be decrypted in the future, even if the long-term encryption keys of the sender and receiver are compromised.\n\nPacket Analysis\nBurpsuite\nHow packet sniffers work?\n\nCollection of the packet → Promiscuous mode\nConversion\nAnalysis\n\n\nIssues that need to be solved by protocols:\n\nConnection Initiation\nNegotiation of connection characteristics (handshaking)\nData formatting\nError Detection and Correction\nConnection Termination\n\n\n\nThe OSI model uses specific terms to describe packaged data at each layer. The physical layer contains bits, the data link layer contains frames, the network layer contains packets, and the transport layer contains segments. The top three layers simply use the term data. This nomenclature isn’t used much in practice, so we’ll generally just use the term packet to refer to a complete or partial PDU that includes header and footer information from a few or many layers of the OSI model. (encapsulation of data)\nThe extent to which broadcast packets can travel is called the broadcast\ndomain, which is the network segment where any computer can directly transmit to another computer without going through a router.\nWireshark\n\nFrom ChatGPT:\nWireshark, the digital detective for networks, captures and unveils the content of data \"packets\" traveling through your network. An Ethernet frame acts like an envelope for this data, containing layers like IP (with addresses) and TCP (ensuring reliable data transfer). Importantly, each layer carries information from the layer above, and Wireshark helps you dissect these layers, revealing the intricate details of your network's communication. Understanding the Ethernet frame is key, as it serves as the outer layer transporting information across the network.\nYoutube Tutorial\nctrl-m → mark packet\nshift-ctrl-n → next marked packet // shift-ctrl-b → previous(back) marked packet.\ntime shift and time ref is useful (time ref → ctrl-t)\nOutput Tab → for logging data.\nThe ping command generates ICMP traffic.\nCapture and Display filters. Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) → expressions.\n\nCapture Filters are applied before a “Packet Capturing Session”\n\nA common scenario is to capture only TCP packets with the RST flag\nset. Offset 13 has the TCP’s packet flags. The Capture Filter to get the a flag is: tcp[13] &amp; 4 == 4 this filter gets the RST flag.\nCommonly Used Capture Filters:\n\ntcp[13] &amp; 32 == 32 TCP packets with the URG flag set\ntcp[13] &amp; 16 == 16 TCP packets with the ACK flag set\ntcp[13] &amp; 8 == 8 TCP packets with the PSH flag set\ntcp[13] &amp; 4 == 4 TCP packets with the RST flag set\ntcp[13] &amp; 2 == 2 TCP packets with the SYN flag set\ntcp[13] &amp; 1 == 1 TCP packets with the FIN flag set\ntcp[13] == 18 TCP SYN-ACK packets\nether host 00:00:00:00:00:00 Traffic to or from your MAC address\n!ether host 00:00:00:00:00:00 Traffic not to or from your MAC address\nbroadcast Broadcast traffic only\nicmp ICMP traffic\nicmp[0:2] == 0x0301 ICMP destination unreachable, host unreachable\n\n\n\n\nDisplay filters are applied and can be reverted. (A common case is to “hide” arp packets)\n\nAnalyze → Display Filters. GUI for creating filters.\nformat: protocol.feature.subfeature\nCommonly Used Display Filters:\n\nip.addr==192.168.0.33\n!tcp.port==3389 Filter out RDP traffic\ntcp.flags.syn==1 TCP packets with the SYN flag set\ntcp.flags.reset==1 TCP packets with the RST flag set\n!arp Clear ARP traffic\nhttp All HTTP traffic\ntcp.port==23 || tcp.port==21 Telnet or FTP traffic\nsmtp || pop || imap Email traffic (SMTP, POP, or IMAP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer3, Network Layer Protocols: ARP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, and ICMPv6.\n\nEthernet is Layer2 → Data Link\nARP:\n”MAC addresses are needed because a switch that interconnects devices\non a network uses a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table, which lists the MAC addresses of all devices plugged into each of its ports. When the switch receives traffic destined for a particular MAC address, it uses this table to know which port to send the traffic through. If the destination MAC address is unknown, the transmitting device will first check for the address in its cache; if the address isn’t there, then it must be resolved through additional communication on the network. The resolution process that TCP/IP networking (with IPv4) uses to resolve an IP address to a MAC address is called the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is defined in RFC 826. The ARP resolution process uses only two packets: an ARP request and an ARP response.” - ARP request (The packet destination address is the broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)→ Asks for the MAC address given an IP.\nARP response → responds to the request with the MAC address of the device whose IP address matches the one that was sent in the request. - The gratuitous ARP packet → when ip changes and for load balancing. - ARP is Layer2/3\nIP:\n\nIPv4 &amp; IPv6 // Netmask // CIDR notation. The Netmask determines which part corresponds to the network and which part corresponds to the host.\nTTL: Time to Live Defines the lifetime of the packet, measured in hops or seconds through routers.\nICMP uses IP to deliver Packages.\nIP is Layer3\nIP Fragmentation → Divides the IP packet based on the Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU).\nIPv6: Hop Limit Defines the lifetime of the packet, measured in hops\nthrough routers. This field replaces the TTL field in IPv4.\nIPv6 doesn’t support broadcast traffic because broadcast is viewed as an inefficient mechanism for transmission.\nNeighbor Solicitation, a function of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which utilizes ICMPv6(similar to ARP). Is used to find IPv6 devices.\nIPv6 fragmentation used MTU discovery. Routers do not fragment packets. If the packets sent are too big, an ICMPv6 packet is sent to the initial sender.\nIPv6 Transitional protocols(encapsulation):\n\n6to4\nTeredo\nISATAP\n\n\n\n\nICMP\n\nRelies on IP, it has a checksum.\nSome firewalls block pings (ICMP).\nThe random text used in an ICMP echo request can be of great interest to a potential attacker. Attackers can use the information in this padding to profile the operating system used on a device.\n\n\n\n\nLayer4, Transport Layer Protocols:\n\nTCP:\n\nports\nreliable\nflags (give status)\nTCP Three-Way Handshake\n\nhostA sends a packet with SYN flag active.\nhostB sends a response with SYN and ACK flag active.\nhostA responds with ACK flag active.\n\n\nTCP Teardown → FIN/ACK handshake → gracefully end connection.\nTCP Reset → RST flag → indicates that a connection was closed abruptly.\n\n\nUDP:\n\nfast but not reliable\nNo handshake\nThe application-layer protocols DNS and DHCP, which are highly dependent on the speed of packet transmission across a network, use UDP as their transport layer protocol, but they handle error checking and retransmission timers themselves.\n\n\n\n\nLayer7, Application Layer Protocols.\n\nDHCP\n\nAllows a device to get an IP address dynamically.\nDORA process (dev → DHCP server):\n\nDiscover →\nOffer ←\nRequest →\nAcknowledgment ←\n\n\nThe DHCP server leases the ip address to the client, when the time passes, the DORA process is performed again(without ‘DO’), the server may offer the same IP if it wasn’t taken.\nDHCPv6 uses SARR:\n\nSolicit →\nAdvertise ←\nRequest →\nReply ←\n\n\n\n\nDNS\n\nMaps an IP to a domain(human readable format)\nDevice → Queries → DNS server\nDevice ← Reply ← DNS server\nDNS server Recursion, one server may request an IP from another server.\nDNS zones divide responsibility for namespaces.\n\nAXFR and IXFR\n“The data contained in a zone transfer can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. For example, by enumerating a single DNS server, you can map a network’s entire infrastructure.”\n\n\n\n\nHTTP\n\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the delivery mechanism of the World Wide Web.\nAn HTTP server is usually on TCP port 80.\nHTTP header:\n\nHeader example: “GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n”\nThis information tells us that the client is sending a request to download (GET) the root web directory (/) of the web server using version 1.1 of HTTP.\n\n\n\n\nSMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.\nWhen you send a message, it’s sent from your MUA to a mail transfer agent (MTA). The MTA is often referred to as the mail server, with popular mail server applications being Microsoft Exchange or Postfix.\nThe MTA must use DNS to find the location address of the recipient mail server.\nRetrieving email from a mailbox on a SMTP server is done with POP3 or IMAP. TLS encryption is used.\n\n\nPort mirroring is probably not an option on the SOHO switch. Our best bet is to use a cheap tap(hardware) or to perform ARP cache poisoning(man in the middle attack // software) to intercept these packets.\nA computer will typically use its hosts file as the authoritative source for DNS name-to-IP address mappings, and it will check that file before querying an outside source. /etc/hosts\n\n\n\n","id":"https://fborello-lambda.github.io/notes_at_lambdaclass/linux-and-networking/","title":"Linux and Networking"},"https://fborello-lambda.github.io/notes_at_lambdaclass/phoenix-extra/":{"body":"Phoenix\n\nFLAME\nDokku - PaaS\nPhoenix Real Case\nPhoenix 1.7: A Major Step for the Phoenix Framework – Nimble\n\nPhoenix LiveView\n\nElixir Streams |&gt; Phoenix forms without changesets!\nTailwind\n\nTailwind Tutorial\nHeroicons\n\n\nA good way to use \"Views\" with liveview is to put them in app_web/live/view1.ex.

However, Minikube offers detailed tutorials and thorough documentation.\nSo, the necessary tools are:\n\ndocker → runs the Minikube container.\nminikube → helps create the Kubernetes cluster (Docker Desktop can also create a Kubernetes context/cluster).\nkubectl → CLI used to orchestrate our pods.\n\nPods, Nodes, and The Control Plane\nThe Control Plane is the main node responsible for supervising our nodes. Nodes, also known as kubelets, are VMs or physical computers with the Docker engine running. Each Node hosts Pods, where a single pod represents an instance of any given app.\nIn summary, our cluster is managed by the Control Plane. We can have multiple Nodes (docker engines) where apps can be deployed, and we will have $N$ Pods depending on the number of instances we decide to deploy.\nThe magic behind Kubernetes lies in its pods; a single pod represents an application, and each application can consist of multiple Docker containers. In simple terms, multiple pods can handle many containers. If one container or even the entire pod fails, Kubernetes will manage this situation by reloading the containers and/or pods.\nHands On\nIf using Minikube, we start our Minikube context:\n\nkubectl works as follows: kubectl &lt;action&gt; &lt;resource&gt;\nActionDescription\ngetRetrieves one or more resources from the cluster.\ndescribeProvides detailed information about a specific resource or group of resources.\napplyApplies configuration changes to resources by creating or updating them.\ndeleteDeletes one or more resources from the cluster.\nlogsRetrieves the logs of a specific pod or container.\nexecExecutes a command inside a specific pod.\nport-forwardSets up a port forward from a local port to a port on a pod.\nscaleScales the number of replicas of a deployment, replication controller, or replica set.\nlabelAdds or updates labels on resources.\nannotateAdds or updates annotations on resources.\neditEdits a resource in the default editor or the editor specified by the KUBE_EDITOR or EDITOR env.\n\nTo ask for our context:\n\nTo get our nodes:\n\nOutput:\n\nHere the docker-desktop node acts as the control-plane.\nThe easiest way to have an app managed by the control-plane is by deploying a docker-image:\n\nWe can also deploy more neatly by using a file:\nk8s_deployment:\n\nTo deploy with this file:\n\nNow if we take a look at the deployments:\n\nWe can observe our deployment with 3/3 pods ready. If we change the number of replicas and then we run the command, the kubernetes control-plane will automatically adjust the number of pods.\nTo get the pods with extra info:\n\nIf, by any chance, a pod stops, Kubernetes will automatically restart it, even if the pod is deleted:\n\nA resize can be performed as follows:\n\nThe pods are attached to the deployment, which is always supervised.\nTo delete the deployment:\n\nWe can delete everything that a file has created with the following command:\n\nNetworking &amp; Load Balancing\nThe above deployment file contains 3 pods with containerPort set to 8080. Since we can resize our pods, the IPs are dynamic. It's preferable to have a method that preserves access to any number of pods.\nBefore demonstrating the preferred method, let's explore kubectl proxy.\nEnsure the deployment is running and open a new terminal:\n\nOutput: Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001\nNow, if we ask for the name of the pods:\n\nOutput:\n\nWe can access to each pod individually with the following URL:\n\nServices\nFrom the Docs:\n\nA Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.\n\n\nA service routes traffic across the defined pods.\n\nTable of services:\nTypeDescription\nClusterIPExposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster.\nNodePortExposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port (NodePort). Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using &lt;NodeIP&gt;:&lt;NodePort&gt;.\nLoadBalancerExposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.\nExternalNameMaps the Service to the contents of the externalName field, returning a CNAME record. No proxying is set up.\n\nA service can be created with the kubectl expose &lt;deployment&gt; --type=&lt;type&gt; --port=&lt;port&gt;. However, it can also be defined in a .yml file.\nFor example, if we want to use a LoadBalancer service with our existing deployment file, add the following configuration at the end and add the role label to the deployment:\n\nNow if we apply the file:\n\nAnd then we do a curl, we should have access to the LoadBalancer:\n\n\n[!NOTE]\nIf using minikube, the service has to be exposed minikube service hello-service --url\n\nThe LoadBalancer service handles the case where it doesn't matter which pod you are accessing and it even takes into account the network traffic.\nIngress\nIngress is an Nginx server that simplifies the creation of paths and can distribute traffic load.\nWhat happens if there are two nodes running multiple pods, each hosting different APIs, and the goal is to manage all traffic through a single URL?\nFor example, if we want to have 2 versions of a given URL and another for developing we cmay want the following scheme:\n\nurl/v1\nurl/v2\nurl/dev\n\nIn such case, we will have a deployment for each app, which may have multiple replicas as pods, then a service to manage the pods' networking and finally the Ingress controller.\nHelm\n\nThe package manager for Kubernetes\nHelm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes\n\nWith helm, the Ingress controller can be installed with the following command:\n\n\nNow, paste the definition of the Ingress controller inside the deployment file:\n\nApply the changes:\n\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe Ingress Node is in another namespace: Namespaces | Kubernetes\n\nFinally, the curl command returns the expected output:\n\nResources\n\nLearn Kubernetes Basics | Kubernetes\nminikube start | minikube\nKubernetes Explained in 15 Minutes | Hands On (2024 Edition) - YouTube\nKubernetes 101: Deploying Your First Application! - YouTube\nKUBERNETES De NOVATO a PRO!

Keeping the state of the project and applying just the changes.\nHands On\nStarting with the proposed tutorial, after having terraform installed, let's create a new file:\n\nThe first block sets the provider, which handles the needed resources/infrastrucre, that will be used, in this case \"kreuzwerker/docker\". There are many providers: Browse Providers | Terraform Registry.\nThen, a resource is declared, which is an infrastructure component, it may be a physical server or a logical service such as a dns service or even a storage component.\nIn this example, there are two resources, an image and a container, the image is used to create the container. The two strings of the resource block are the resource's type and name.\nA clearer way to declare a resource, since we may have multiple resources of the same type could be naming them as follows: instanceN: resource \"docker_container\" \"container1\".\n.tfvars and  variables.tf\nThe variables.tf is used to define variables such as:\n\n\nSince it's sensitive, it will not be compromised in any way.\n\nAnd then we can set the variable with the next descending order of prescedence:\n\nterraform apply -var secret_name=secret\nusing a *.auto.tfvars\n\nin the file: secret_name=secret\n\n\nusing terraform.tfvars\n\nin the file: secret_name=secret\n\n\nusing an ENV variable: TF_VAR_&lt;name&gt;\n\nthis case: TF_VAR_secret_name\n\n\ndefault = value\nif the above options are not present, the command terraform apply will show a prompt to provide the variable\n\nModules\nIf there is a file we want to reuse we can import it into another file, for example with this project structure:\n\ninside ./main.tf the ./modules/api/main.tf can be imported as follows:\n\nProject Structure for different deployments\nWe can use Workspaces but may be confusing down the road, a better setup is to divide the infrastructure needed depending on the purpose of it.\nFor example, a good project structure may be:\n\nIf inside of workspaces/dev we do:\n\nit only initializes the infrastructure defined in workspaces/dev/main.tf\nThe idea of having a global directory is to have infrastructure that is common for both dev and prod.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThe provider is not declared inside the main.tf file.

After providing it, Google Cloud will create the specified resource defined in main.tf, such as google_compute_network named net_instance1. You can access the name attribute of this resource using google_compute_network.net_instance1.name. Remember, you can define multiple instances of any resource by defining them as follows:\n\nresource x instance1\nresource x instance2\n\n\nVPC networks &nbsp;|&nbsp; Google Cloud\n\nCompute Instance\nHaving the network set, we can connect a computer right adding it as resource.\n\nThe compute_instance is making use of the net_instance1 previously declared.\nNow if we run terraform apply, the compute instance will be created, but we'll not have access to it.\nFirewall Instance\nThe missing piece is the Firewall, the port 22 has to be exposed. The Firewall has to be applied to our network:\n\nNow with the Firewall enabled, we have to target the compute_instance in use. The firewall makes use of the target_tags, we've just need to add \"ssh-server\" inside the tags array of the compute_instance:\n\nWe just need one more piece, a static public IP. It can be declared with a resource and then use the IP for the compute_instance:\n\nIn fact, it is not strictly necessary to declare the compute_address resource, if the access_config field is left without the nat_ip, terraform will create a static public IP automatically.\n\n[!WARNING]\nAnyone can reach the compute_instance since the firewall allows connections from any address.\nAccess is granted only with the correct keys.
